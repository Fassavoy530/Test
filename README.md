# NYUSH_Information_Visualization_Fall2023_Final_Project

This is a course project for DATS-SHU 235 Information Visualization, completed with my teammate Tianqing Yu and guided by Prof. Xianbin Gu. <br> <br>

Non-pharmaceutical interventions is a significant part in regulating health. In order to help people understand how diets have the potential to alleviate effects from chronic diseases and some communicable diseases, we implemented an interactive visualization about the correlation between protein intake structure and COVID-19 case fatality rate, and the correlation between protein intake structure and obesity rate. <br><br>

The visualization was built primarily using JavaScript, D3 and React.
